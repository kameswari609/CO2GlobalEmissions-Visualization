# Project-2
## OBJECTIVE 

Understand the history of emissions by nation. 
More than ever consumers are demanding their products & services minimize pollution harmful to our planet. 
Companies like Microsoft, Starbucks, Adidas, and Jetblue have all made carbon neutral commitments in the next 5-10 years. 
As we learn through the data (and you can too), coming out of WW2 & both major financial crises emissions spiked as businesses increased production to support economic growth. 
Due to public measures taken to tame COVID-19, researchers are projecting fossil fuel emissions to be down 8% globally in 2020. 
There isnâ€™t a more important time to prioritize clean energy as businesses re-open and the economy starts back up.
